## Features

The project provides an interface to read and write plist files in binary,
XML, JSON, or OpenStep format alongside a command-line utility named `plistutil`.

Some key features are:

- **Formats:** Supports binary, XML, JSON, and OpenStep format
- **Utility:** Provides a `plistutil` utility for the command-line
- **Python:** Provides Cython based bindings for Python
- **Tested:** Uses fuzzing and data compliance tests
- **Efficient:** Lean library with performance and resources in mind

## Installation / Getting started

### Debian / Ubuntu Linux

First install all required dependencies and build tools:
```shell
sudo apt-get install \
	build-essential \
	checkinstall \
	git \
	autoconf \
	automake \
	libtool-bin
```

If you want to optionally build the documentation or Python bindings use:
```shell
sudo apt-get install \
	doxygen \
	cython3
```

Then clone the actual project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist.git
cd libplist
```

Now you can build and install it:
```shell
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

Then simply run:
```shell
plistutil -i foobar.plist -o output.plist
```
This converts the `foobar.plist` file to the opposite format, e.g. binary to
XML or vice versa, and outputs it to the `output.plist` file.

To convert to a specific format - and also to convert from JSON or OpenStep
format - use the `-f` command line switch:
```shell
plistutil -i input.plist -f json
```
This will convert input.plist, regardless of the input format, to JSON. The
code auto-detects the input format and parses it accordingly.

Please consult the usage information or manual page for a full documentation of
available command line options:
```shell
plistutil --help
man plistutil
```
